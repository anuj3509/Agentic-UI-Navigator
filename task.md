# Softlight Engineering Take-Home Assignment

## Task

You're building part of an AI multi-agent system. Agent A sends your agent, Agent B, different questions at runtime: like "How do I create a project in [Linear](https://linear.app/test916/team/TES/active)?" or “How do I filter a database in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)?”. 

**Your goal:** Build the system that shows Agent A how to perform the requested task. It should automatically navigate the live app and capture screenshots of each UI state in the workflow. Agent B ***won’t know these tasks ahead of time***, so your system must be generalizable: it should handle any kind of request, across different web apps, and capture the right UI states ***in real time***.

## The Problem

Not every UI state has a URL. Consider what needs to be captured for "creating a project in Linear":

- The project list page (has a URL)
- The "Create Project" button state
- The create modal (no URL)
- The form fields (no URL)
- Maybe the success state

Your system needs to navigate the live application and capture these states programmatically on the fly.

## Testing

Pick 1–2 web apps (e.g. Linear, Notion, Asana, etc). To test your system, you can ***define a few example tasks yourself*** (like “creating a project,” “filtering issues,” or “changing settings”). But your implementation ***shouldn’t rely on these being hardcoded***. The goal is to show that your system’s approach could generalize to other apps and tasks it hasn’t seen before.

**What we want to see:**

- Capture 3-5 different tasks/workflows across your chosen app(s)
- Thoughtful approach to navigating and capturing non-URL states

## Deliverables

1. **Code** - Your UI state capture system
2. **Loom** - A short [loom](https://www.loom.com/) where you show the agent running through a workflow and explain how it works.
3. **Dataset** - Captured UI states for 3-5 tasks across 1-2 apps, organized by task. Accompanied by a short blurb explaining the tasks. Structure this in the best way you see fit.

## Practical Details

- **Time:** Up to a week.
- **Tools:** Use whatever you want - any languages, frameworks, libraries.
- **Scope**: Focus on quality. We'd rather see 3-5 tasks captured well than 20 tasks captured poorly.
